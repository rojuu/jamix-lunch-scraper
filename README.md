# jamix-lunch-scraper

Web scraper for Kajaani University of Applied Science's Jamix lunch menus. Built using Node.js.

## Usage
Setup using ´npm init´. Run using ´npm start´.

## Dependencies
Using puppetteer for rendering and scraping, because jamix is built with some dynamic js magic, so we need a chromium instance to render it.
